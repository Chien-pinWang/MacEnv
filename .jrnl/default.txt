2017-03-07 18:00 Another Bleeding Event

@mom, @cancer, @vgh

Got a call from Catherine at around 3pm saying mom is heavily bleeding like last November. Blood flushed into the ostomy bag and make it full after she took a leak. Her blood pressure dropped and face turned white quickly. She was sent to CT scan and followed by angiography. After about an hour the angiography team found the bleeding came from the same spot as last November. A stent that is longer than the last one was put in place to cover the weak artery. That has effectively
stopped the bleeding. Mom was sent to ICU as instructed by Dr. Yen.

Mom lost about 750 cc of blood at ward 82, and 400 afterward in the angiography operation and ICU. Several blood was transfused to keep her pumped.

- A soft link was made at ~/tmp/drewr3.dat

2017-03-08 11:00 Visit Mom at VGH ICU

@mom, @cancer, @vgh

Mom seemed has a good sleep last night. Her vitals are all good with blood pressure at 140/70 and blood oxygen near 100. One ICU doctor came in and explained that her bleeding has stopped, and all vitals are good. Dr. Yen may visit her at noon after his operation in the morning. By looking at her eyes I can tell that she is in a much better shape than yesterday.

She complains back pain and I put the oil on her back. Told her to press the button if feels hungry. She may be released from ICU today/tomorrow if Dr. Yen says so.

@mom, @cancer, @vgh

Keep good spirit as more blood transfused to pump up mom's red blood cell count. Dr Yen came to see mom and talked about using artificial artery to strengthen the weak vessel. Dr. Tsai also visited her and she needs to explain how this bleeding is related to the by-pass surgery she performed early this year.

It's likely that mom can be out of ICU and back to regular ward tomorrow. That's a good thing.

2017-03-10 23:46 Visit Mom at Ward 82 Bed 28, VGH

@mom, @cancer, @VGH

Mom was discharged from ICU today at around 5:30pm. She got a bed at Ward 82. It's more relaxed here with all the monitoring equipments detached.

She is not bleedng any more. Vitals are all good. Doctor prescribed Kalium because she has hypokalemic as a result of bleeding. She took Kalium tablets and IV.

Both Dr. Yen and Dr. Tsai did not show up today. I'm staying at her bed side tonight.

2017-03-11 10:28 Stay Overnight at VGH with Mom

@mom, @cancer, @VGH

Mom complained about itchy head. Her roommate called for hair wash service so I asked the service lady to give her a hair wash as well. It makes her feel much better after the $280 hair wash.

Dr. Yen came visit her and was worried about the bleeding situation as a result of radiation therapy. He asked if we talked to Dr. Tsai, and advised not to move too much before the bleeding completely stops. I believe he is looking for ways to help.

2017-03-12 05:17 Mac Bash Color and File Input Output

@bash, @color, @read

Lessons learned while trying to write a bash shell script showing content of a file with color code in it....

- Use "echo -e" to show message with color code in it
- Color code look up: http://misc.flogisoft.com/bash/tip_colors_and_formatting
- The "\e" prefix in all codes does not work in Mac bash, use "\033" instead
    - For example: instead of using "\e[0m" to reset, use "\033[0m" instead
- Simple script to display a text file line by line to terminal:
    #!/bin/bash
    while read line
    do
        echo -e "$line"
    done < file.txt
- Color code can be embeded in file.txt, but need to escape the escape character "\". So in file.txt, for example:
    \\033[1mMake this line bold\\033[0m
    This line is normal
- Different color effects can be combined by putting their codes together seperated by ";"
    - \033[31;107m
        - 31: Red Text (Foreground)
        - 107: White Background
    - \033[39;49m
        - 39: Reset to Default Text (Foreground)
        - 49: Reset to Default Background
- CAUTION: Use color codes in $PS1 (command prompt) will cause long command line unable to wrap to the next line.

2017-03-13 10:32 Bleeding Stops and Still on Fast

@mom, @cancer, @VGH

Obviously the bleeding from ostomy has stopped. The stent has effectively prevent the vein from bleeding. Saw 140 cc from ostomy yesterday, mostly water. But there are still 60 cc from the pig-tail. The fluid at pig-tail is more like blood. It is still a concern but see if the amount gradually drops.

Dr. Yen came this morning with surgery suit. He is happy that the quantity and quality of fluid from the ostomy is improving. He would like to give it some more time to get conditions more stable. Only water is allowed.

Dr. Tsai is still not showing up. She is supposed to be the person who can exaplain what's going on...

2017-03-13 14:19 Crontab Format on Mac OS

@bash, @MacBookPro, @cron

When I tried to setup cron jobs on this new MacBook Pro, I got e-mail saying:

    /bin/sh: Applications: command not found

And I tried a few times with different commands but still got the same result. It turned out that the crontab in Mac OS only has "5" time fields, followed by the command to be executed. These fields are:

    - Minute, 0 ~ 59
    - Hour, 0 ~ 23
    - Day in Month, 1 ~ 31
    - Month, 1 ~ 12
    - Week Day, 1 ~ 7

I got an additional field for year, and Mac OS took everything after the fifth time field as the command. That's why it was complaining "command not found."

2017-03-15 13:12 Bash Data Manipulations

@bash

More things learned through the development of the ~/tmp/tDepends.sh script:

- Data Array
    - Array is 0-index
    - Simple form: arrayVar=(1 2 3 4 5), elements seperated by ' ' (a space)
- Numeric Variable Calculation
    - Data type of a variable depends on the context
    - To evaluate an expression, use $(( expression )) format
        - Example var=$(($var+1)) (Or $var++ would work)
        - Only works for INTEGER
    - So better pipe the expression to 'bc' instead
        - Example var=$(echo "scale=2; $var/4" | bc)
- Function Return Value
    - Bash function CANNOT return value.
    - Use echo to print to stdout in the function
    - Use var=$(func $arg1 $arg2) to capture the output string in the calling function
- Need to build my own function libraries in ~/.env/.sh
    - math.sh, for math functions
    - string.sh, for string functions
    - array.sh, for array functions

2017-03-15 17:35 Bash Function tDepends Show Task Dependency in TaskWarrior

@bash, @task

Sort of released the first version of tDepends in the ~/.env/.task/.taskwarrior bash script. Script interacts with taskWarrior and list all dependencies of a given task ID in a tree format. Attributes include:

- ID
- Status
- Description
- Due

Bash color escape sequences are also applied to show all active tasks in red, deleted tasks in revers dim, completed tasks in dim, and goal task in bright. Learned quite a bit from this development experience.

2017-03-15 17:44 Goal Oriented Task Workflow

@task

Since function tDepends shows task dependencies properly, the whole task management workflow should now turn to 'Goal Oriented, Review to Adhere' philosophy.

- Planning
    - Set Quarterly, Monthly, and Weekly goals
    - Break down the goals into modules and sub-tasks
    - Relate all tasks pointing to the same goal with task dependency
    - Set due day and schedule day for all the tasks
    - Create project home at ~/prj/<project name>
- Review
    - Run tReview to start working on tasks scheduled on the day
    - Run tActive to work on and complete active tasks
    - Keep project related files at its project home
    - Run tWeek to see tasks due that week
    - Run tOverdue to catch up over due tasks
    - Run tSummary to see achievements
    - Run jNew to write down lessons learned
- Celebrate!

2017-03-15 20:56 Met My Flute Teacher 高晟 on Subway to Work

@高晟, @李清光, @李清志, @馮品晶

A lady bumped me right after boarding on the subway train at Taipei Main Station and asked if I were 建斌. She was my flute teach back in 2001. She is on her way to a studio of a radio station recording a program. We traded a lot of concerns to families of each other's. I shared that my parents are all converted to Christianity a few years back. And mom is seriously illed at hospital. She shared that they are all around in the 天母 neightborhood. 清光 still works at home.

She asked if appropriate can they visit mom. We promised to stay in touch and seperated when I got to my stop.

2017-03-16 18:31 Establish My Ledger

@ledger

Follow the documentation of ledger 3.0 (http://ledger-cli.org/3.0/doc/ledger3.html), I have successfully established my ledger with opening balances of all major accounts. Lessons learned are:

- Express value as commodity unit instead of money unit
    - DYA for DingYuApartment
    - DYP for DingYuParking
    - "5913" for 安聯綠能基金
- Setup price table at the beginning of the file
- Various useful command line options:
    - "-V" converts commodities to its latest price in price history (Lines start with "P")
    - "-B" converts commodities to its cost price (expressed as "@ <price>" in the transaction)
    - "-G" reports net gain or loss of commodities that have price history and cost.
- Set money in wallet as "Petty Cash" in the "Expenses" category, meaning it is expensed as it was withdrawed

2017-03-17 11:21 肺炎鏈球菌疫苗

@mom, @cancer

It's been almost a year since mom removed her spleen. Dr. Yen advised that patients with spleen removed tend to be less immunable to various infections. And suggested to receive 肺炎鏈球菌疫苗 injection. She got one shot about a year ago.

I am wondering if repeating injection is necessary for that vaccine. Googled and found out that there two types of the vaccine: old, 23 價 and new, 13 價. Human body makes no memory of the old one so need repeating injections every 2 to 4 years.

Study shows that the effectiveness of the old one is a bit over 40% in the first two years after injection, drop to 20% afterward. The old type covers 11 more virus than the new one, but short of one critical substance. Doctors are moving away from the old type now.

Problem is, I don't know whicht type mom received last year. Need to find out.

2017-03-17 18:17 More Use of Ledger Reporting

@ledger, @bash

Combining ledger-cli and bash, it looks like I can do so many things about my personal finance on the command line. Here are stuffs I learned today:

- Most of the command line options can be set in ~/.ledgerrc file
    - "--date-format" specifies the date format string used on the reports
    - "--strict" let ledger send warnings when accounts, commodities, tags are not pre-defined.
- Files can be included by the "include <file>" directive in the ledger file
    - include "accounts.dat" for allowed account names
        - More granular controls can be specified as directives under "account"
    - include "commodities.dat" for allowed commodities
    - include "tags.dat" for allowed tags
    - include "prices.dat" for price history
- Developed bash shell script "getPeriodBeginEnd" to get begin and end dates of a date period keyword
    - Mac bash syntax uses "-v" to adjust date:
        Tomorrow's date: date -v+1d +%Y-%m-%d
            "-v" +1d move 1 day forward from today
        First day of the last week: date -v-7d -vsunday +%Y-%m-%d
            "-v" -7d move 7 days backward from today, then
            "-v" sunday adjusted to the last sunday of the last adjusted date
    - script returns begin date and end date of the corresponding keyword seperated by a space. For example: "2017-03-10 2017-03-17" for the last 7 days period ("week")
- Developed bash shell scripts to query register of different accounts in ledger by different time period keywords. So we can do, for example:
    - "lSCSB mtd" for the month-to-date transactions on SCSB credit card
    - "lCash week" for the last 7 day transactions on petty cash
    etc...

2017-03-18 10:04 Trying Out vim Plugin Management vim-plug

@vim

Comparing different vim plugin managements among the followings, it looks like vim-plug is worth to try:

    - Pathogen (https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)
         More like a run-time loader than a real plug-in manager
    - Vundle (https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)
         Most popular but development is stall
    - vim-plug (https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
         Newest of the three, support on-demand loading

Usage is easy:

    - Create a "Plug" section with names of plug-ins to load in the .vimrc file.    - Re-load .vimrc
    - Run ":PlugInstall" to start managing the plug-ins listed in the .vimrc

2017-03-18 23:29 Tenant Ms. Lin Request to Transfer Household Registration

@E624014F

I need to give her the original copy of the last year's household tax slip for her to transfer their household registrations. There is no way to refuse it. And my cost will increase (rental income now becomes taxable).

A couple of things need to be reminded (source: http://bbs.591.com.tw/f?action=replay&tid=18767):

- 出租之房子無法享有自用住宅稅率，地價稅、土地增值稅也會提高.
    - 每年要繳的地價稅稅率會從原來自用0.2%變成1%、增加5倍.
    - 房屋稅如果房客仍供住家使用者，稅額不變。
- 承租人每年會開立你個人的房屋租賃所得扣繳憑單，會增加個人的綜合所得額。
    - 列舉扣除租賃合理而必要的損耗及費用:
        如折舊、 修理費、 地價稅、 房屋稅及其附加捐、 以該房屋為保險標的物所投保的保險費、 向金融機構貸款購屋而出租所支付利息等之憑證。
    - 不列舉必要的損耗及費用者： 依財政部頒定之必要損耗及費用標準 (97年度為43％)
    - 房客將戶籍遷入後，發生卡債欠繳、官司纏身.....等問題.房客逃離卻沒將戶籍遷出.之後所有法院的傳票、甚至"財務管理"公司都會到他的戶籍地址進行一些"必要"的動作，對於房東來說，會是很煩的一件事。
    - 房客租約到期搬離，但是戶籍卻沒遷出. (Return the deposit only when they transfer theiir household registration away)

I have pay my due by fixing the equipments in the apartment and allowing them to transfer their household registrations. There is no way I will give them any rent reduction next year.

2017-03-20 08:29 Installed vim Snippet Engine SirVer/UltiSnips

@vim

I installed honza/vim-snippets (https://github.com/honza/vim-snippets) and thought of it as a snippet engine. vim-snippets turned out to be just a collection of the "snippets" themselves. It requires an engine to use them.

According to the author of vim-snippets, SirVer/UltiSnips (https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips) is a better engine if vim is compiled with python enabled. It works with two snippets written in VimL (vim without python support) and snipmate-snippets. It has the following advantages:

- Faster
- Nesting Snippets
- Expanding Snippets in Snippet
- Transformations on Text in Snippets

It turned out that "jrnl" has problems invoking vim with UlitSnips' auto detection feature. The editor keeps spitting error messages when key is pressed. I have not found a way to resolve it yet.

2017-03-21 08:47 Installed and Configured Mutt

@mutt, @email

Installed the cli e-mail client Mutt to access GMail from command line. Dived a little bit into its macro and key binding so I can type "y" to archive an e-mail (move to "[GMail]/All Mail" folder); or type "d" to trash an e-mail (move to "[GMail]/Trash" folder) at the remote IMAP server.

At the "index" page (e-mail listing view) I re-configured the binding of <space> for next page, and "-" for previous page, just to make it consistent with the "pager" view. There should be more can be done with Mutt.

* Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT):
    Being able to defend against Byzantine Failures so that systems can still provide its services despite of the presence of the Byzantine Failures.

* Byzantine General's Problem:
    Several Byzantine Generals encircled a city from different directions. They have to reach the agreement on the strategy wheather to attact or retreat. Any half-way decisions (partially attact or partially retreat) will be the worst strategy and cost the army.
    Problem is further complicated by if the generals are seperated and communicating via messengers, or some of them are traitors who vote for sub-optimal strategies purposely.
    Byzantine Falut Tolerance can be achieved if the loyal generals can reach unanimous agreement on their strategy.

2017-03-22 10:55 What is a Byzantine Fault and Byzantine Fault Tolerance?

@memory

The answer is:

    Byzantine Fault: Any fault presenting different symptoms to different observers.

    Byzantine Fault Tolerance: System that still able to provide its services despite the presence of Byzantine Fault.

2017-03-28 11:40 How to write a journal?

@howto, @journal

# Summary
Journal can be of anything worth writing down to be reflected in the future. Here is my 10-step process learned from wikiHow.

# Key Points
    1. Find something to contain your journal entries
    2. Keep a simple format that can be applied to different topics
    3. Choose to write on specific topic or generally everything
    4. Pick a good entry title
    5. Write down continuously as the thoughts flow. Stay away from everything that can stop your finger following your thoughts.
    6. Deep dive into it and really get inspired by the ideas that jumped out.
    7. Tag the journal entry with key words so it can be accessed by search
    8. Make it a everyday-habbit that you enjoy of doing.
    9. Get creative and with personal touch.
    10. Re-read entries for insights.

# Free Thoughts
    I will keep my journal entries in text files and search/read them through jrnl (http://jrnl.sh). I'll use a simple 3-block format: Summary, Key Points, and Free Thoughts (~/.env/.jrnl/template.txt). I'm going to write down any thing worth to write in the default journal. And the journal will be in English for most of the parts.

    I wish I can keep this going for long by enjoy doing it. So I'm not writing it under any pressure. Unicode expressions can be very helpful 😂...

    God helps me out.

2017-03-28 14:41 ☀️  vim with Unicode Emoji 😎

@vim, @unicode

# Summary
    vim is able to render unicode characters that include single-character icons for weather, emoji, and many others.

# Key Points
    1. Create a text file with frequently used unicode characters for journaling
    2. Map key combination ',uc' to open this file while journaling
       (',uc' maps to ':8sp </path/to/unicode.txt>' where 8 is the window height)
    3. Copy and paste unicode characters for journal expression

# Free Thoughts
    Unicode adds personal touch to the journal. With key maps in vim, I can call this file to a stacked window any time I need it.

    I think I can use the same technique to map cheatsheets of different tools!

2017-03-28 15:22 Video Chat with Chiallin & Alan on IoT Venture

@ChialinChou, @Alan, @IoT

# Summary
    Take action to identify at most 5 problem-solution pairs currently available on the market as a market research effort. From there we need to identify potential market segment our capabilities fit.

# Key Points
    1. Meet Alan (Last name?) face-to-face
    2. Need to start with finding a market segment where demands exist and we are capable of providing solutions.
    3. Go search at most 5 IoT solutions (and their corresponding problems) available on the market.

# Free Thoughts
    Alan seems to be a pretty easy going guy. He supports my suggestion of where to start. Although I don't know too much about him yet.

    We should probably further narrow down our search range to certain industries and certain areas. Will chat again next week.

2017-03-29 07:56 ⛅ My Console "Today"

@MacBookPro, @bash

# Summary
    "today" command shows a summary of today's status

# Key Points
    "today" command lists the following information at the moment:
    1. Current date and time
    2. Current weather and forecast of tomorrow
    3. Titles of journal entries made today
    4. Current cash balance
    5. Today's spending

# Free Thoughts
    I find myself constantly checking these information. So I wrote a bash script called "today" in the .bash_profile. Current date and time uses built-in 'date' function. Weather service is provided by http://wttr.in through 'curl' command. Journal entries and spendings are reflecting my activities of the day.

    With these information easily accessible on my finger tips I rest in peace.😎

Gu-shan District 2016 median price of the real transaction records was $230,000 per ping, increased 6.6% from 2015. That was really encouraging!

# Free Thoughts
    This is an optimistic plan that assumes income stays unchange and expenses control tightly. If we look at the plan from the cash flow's perspective, we need to pay out the payables from March. So we don't generate that much free cash as the plan shows.
    This is the first time we are doing budgets on ledger. We will need to see how it works in terms of the efforts for planning and bookkeeping. Budgeting is done by creating so-call "Budget Envelop" where money puts in at the beginning of the month. March try out works fine.

2017-03-30 11:50 Try Out Google Tag Manager at MacBook Pro

@GTM, @phpmyadmin, @MacBookPro

# Summary
    Play around with Google Tag Manager at my MacBookPro machine.

# Key Points
    1. Add GTM snippet to alpha.com that points to phpMyAdmin
    2. Add a private function _getGTMSnippet() in the Header.php file resides in the [phpMyAdmin]/libraries directory.
    3. Call _getGTMSnippet from the getDisplay() function in the same file before _getMetaTags() and after _getHtmlStart().
    4. Now we should have GTM snippet in every phpMyAdmin page
    5. We can inject tags through GTM snippet now.

# Free Thoughts
    ag is a pretty powerful tool to do string search in a group of files. We started by searching word "<head>" because GTM suggests to place the snippet at the beginning of the head section. ag returned quite a few matched files. By looking at the results, the file "libraries/Header.php" looks like the one we are after. Go into that file and figured out how it spit out the HTML codes and then got snippet injected.

2017-03-30 17:03 Failed to Activate Google Analytics from Google Tag Manager

@GTM, @GA

# Summary
    Made several attempts to activate GA from GTM snippet but failed.

# Key Points
    Installed Google Analytics tag as instructed (Tag name: Google Analytics; Tag Type: Universal Google Analytics; Firing Trigger: All Pages) and clicked on the phpMyAdmin pages. But the real-time traffic in Google Analytics report still did not see a visitor.

    Tried the following remedies after research on the Internet:
    1. Added a field called 'cookieDomain' with value 'none' (for localhost)
    2. Added a field called 'storage' with value 'none' (for localhost)
    3. Removed the filed 'storage'

    None of them work.

# Free Thoughts
    Installed a Chrome plug-in called "Google Tag Assistance" and reload the phpMyAdmin page. An error says that the GTM account ID is invalid or missing. The help page says the ID after "GTM-" should be less than 6 characters. Mine has 7. But the help also says that this is a "false error" and will be resolved in the future update? 😩

2017-03-31 11:20 🌧  GTM Seems to Start Working from Chrome

@GTM

# Summary
    GTM fires Google Analytics Tag from a static page GTM.html at alpha.com, but only through the Chrome browser.

# Key Points
    Put GTM snippet in a static page 'GTM.html' and see the page hit at Google Analytics 'Realtime' report.

# Free Thoughts
    I guess the cookieDomain works only for Chrome browser? Tag is still not fired from phpMyAdmin pages. Keep digging on this....
