2017-03-07 18:00 Another Bleeding Event

@mom, @cancer, @vgh

Got a call from Catherine at around 3pm saying mom is heavily bleeding like last November. Blood flushed into the ostomy bag and make it full after she took a leak. Her blood pressure dropped and face turned white quickly. She was sent to CT scan and followed by angiography. After about an hour the angiography team found the bleeding came from the same spot as last November. A stent that is longer than the last one was put in place to cover the weak artery. That has effectively
stopped the bleeding. Mom was sent to ICU as instructed by Dr. Yen.

Mom lost about 750 cc of blood at ward 82, and 400 afterward in the angiography operation and ICU. Several blood was transfused to keep her pumped.

2017-03-08 11:00 Visit Mom at VGH ICU

@mom, @cancer, @vgh

Mom seemed has a good sleep last night. Her vitals are all good with blood pressure at 140/70 and blood oxygen near 100. One ICU doctor came in and explained that her bleeding has stopped, and all vitals are good. Dr. Yen may visit her at noon after his operation in the morning. By looking at her eyes I can tell that she is in a much better shape than yesterday.

She complains back pain and I put the oil on her back. Told her to press the button if feels hungry. She may be released from ICU today/tomorrow if Dr. Yen says so.

2017-03-08 20:29 Visit Mom at VGH ICU Again

@mom, @cancer, @vgh

Keep good spirit as more blood transfused to pump up mom's red blood cell count. Dr Yen came to see mom and talked about using artificial artery to strengthen the weak vessel. Dr. Tsai also visited her and she needs to explain how this bleeding is related to the by-pass surgery she performed early this year.

It's likely that mom can be out of ICU and back to regular ward tomorrow. That's a good thing.

Tried cli spreadsheet sc (spreadsheet calculator) to capture job leads but it seems not as handy. Turned out setting up a SQLite schema works better.

SQLite script can be developped for frequently used query and run from command line like:
    $ sqlite job.sqlite < _allJobs.sql

2017-03-10 23:46 Visit Mom at Ward 82 Bed 28, VGH

@mom, @cancer, @VGH

Mom was discharged from ICU today at around 5:30pm. She got a bed at Ward 82. It's more relaxed here with all the monitoring equipments detached.

She is not bleedng any more. Vitals are all good. Doctor prescribed Kalium because she has hypokalemic as a result of bleeding. She took Kalium tablets and IV.

Both Dr. Yen and Dr. Tsai did not show up today. I'm staying at her bed side tonight.

2017-03-11 10:28 Stay Overnight at VGH with Mom

@mom, @cancer, @VGH

Mom complained about itchy head. Her roommate called for hair wash service so I asked the service lady to give her a hair wash as well. It makes her feel much better after the $280 hair wash.

Dr. Yen came visit her and was worried about the bleeding situation as a result of radiation therapy. He asked if we talked to Dr. Tsai, and advised not to move too much before the bleeding completely stops. I believe he is looking for ways to help.

2017-03-12 05:17 Mac Bash Color and File Input Output

@bash, @color, @read

Lessons learned while trying to write a bash shell script showing content of a file with color code in it....

- Use "echo -e" to show message with color code in it
- Color code look up: http://misc.flogisoft.com/bash/tip_colors_and_formatting
- The "\e" prefix in all codes does not work in Mac bash, use "\033" instead
    - For example: instead of using "\e[0m" to reset, use "\033[0m" instead
- Simple script to display a text file line by line to terminal:
    #!/bin/bash
    while read line
    do
        echo -e "$line"
    done < file.txt
- Color code can be embeded in file.txt, but need to escape the escape character "\". So in file.txt, for example:
    \\033[1mMake this line bold\\033[0m
    This line is normal
- Different color effects can be combined by putting their codes together seperated by ";"
    - \033[31;107m
        - 31: Red Text (Foreground)
        - 107: White Background
    - \033[39;49m
        - 39: Reset to Default Text (Foreground)
        - 49: Reset to Default Background
- CAUTION: Use color codes in $PS1 (command prompt) will cause long command line unable to wrap to the next line.

2017-03-12 09:00 Philosophical Joke

@Joke

Watched 新聞挖挖哇: 新聞真相20170308 on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5bxWDtiEHM) with mom. This episode is about the fraudery blood fat reduction medicine 冠脂妥. The host '鄭弘儀' shared a joke as follows:

"毛澤東曾說, 世界上最困難的兩件事: 1) 把自己的想法放進別人的腦袋裡; 2) 把別人的錢放進自己的口袋裡. 第一件事做成功了, 叫老師; 第二件事做成功了, 叫老闆; 兩件事都做成功了, 叫老婆. 跟老師鬥是不想學了; 跟老闆鬥是不想混了; 而跟老婆鬥是不想活了."

2017-03-13 10:32 Bleeding Stops and Still on Fast

@mom, @cancer, @VGH

Obviously the bleeding from ostomy has stopped. The stent has effectively prevent the vein from bleeding. Saw 140 cc from ostomy yesterday, mostly water. But there are still 60 cc from the pig-tail. The fluid at pig-tail is more like blood. It is still a concern but see if the amount gradually drops.

Dr. Yen came this morning with surgery suit. He is happy that the quantity and quality of fluid from the ostomy is improving. He would like to give it some more time to get conditions more stable. Only water is allowed.

Dr. Tsai is still not showing up. She is supposed to be the person who can exaplain what's going on...

2017-03-13 14:19 Crontab Format on Mac OS

@bash, @MacBookPro, @cron

When I tried to setup cron jobs on this new MacBook Pro, I got e-mail saying:

    /bin/sh: Applications: command not found

And I tried a few times with different commands but still got the same result. It turned out that the crontab in Mac OS only has "5" time fields, followed by the command to be executed. These fields are:

    - Minute, 0 ~ 59
    - Hour, 0 ~ 23
    - Day in Month, 1 ~ 31
    - Month, 1 ~ 12
    - Week Day, 1 ~ 7

I got an additional field for year, and Mac OS took everything after the fifth time field as the command. That's why it was complaining "command not found."

    if [ condition1 ] || [ condition2 ] && [ condition3 ]
    then
        actions here...
    else
        actions here...

- Condition Expressions:
    - Test if file exists: if [ -f filename ]
    - Test if file readable: if [ -r filename ]
    - Test if $var greater than or equal: if [ $var -ge 3 ]
        - -gt: greater than
        - -lt: less than
        - -eq: equal
        - -le: less than or equal
    - Test string variable: if [ "$var" == "tux" ]
    - Test if $var an empty string or not exists: if [ -z "$var"]
